## 1. Project Overview
This project involves exploratory data analysis and insights extraction from financial and sentiment
datasets. The notebook appears to focus on combining trading and market sentiment data to
identify behavioral or predictive patterns in the cryptocurrency market, specifically around Bitcoin
and Hyperliquid trading activity.
2. Libraries and Environment Setup
The notebook begins with importing essential Python libraries for data analysis and visualization: -
**pandas, numpy** for data manipulation and numerical computation - **matplotlib, seaborn, plotly**
for data visualization - **scipy** for statistical analysis - **datetime** for date handling - **os** for file
system operations It also mounts Google Drive to access and save datasets and outputs in a Colab
environment.
3. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
Two primary datasets are loaded from Google Drive: 1. **Hyperliquid Trader Data** — containing
information about trading behavior, possibly including volume, trader performance, and transaction
characteristics. 2. **Bitcoin Market Sentiment Data** — including date-wise sentiment indicators
that could be used to correlate public market perception with trading performance. Both datasets
are read using pandas and stored in DataFrames (`trader_df` and `sentiment_df`). Basic shape and
preview checks are performed using `.shape` and `.head()`.
4. Data Cleaning and Processing
Although not explicitly visible in the initial cells, typical next steps would include: - Handling missing
values, duplicates, and invalid entries - Data type conversions (e.g., date parsing for time series
analysis) - Filtering relevant columns for analysis - Possibly merging trader and sentiment datasets
on date or time-based keys
5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) likely includes: - Summary statistics (mean, median, variance,
skewness, kurtosis) - Distribution plots for key variables - Correlation heatmaps and pairplots for
identifying relationships - Trend visualization over time using Plotly or Matplotlib The use of
`sns.set()` and `plotly.express` indicates visually rich charts and dashboards were used to identify
trends.
6. Statistical Analysis
The presence of SciPy and statistical imports suggests computation of advanced metrics like
skewness, kurtosis, and z-score analysis for outlier detection. Such techniques help understand
data distribution and identify anomalies or non-normal patterns in trading behavior or sentiment
data.
7. Insights and Outcomes
The likely objective of this notebook is to understand how trading metrics correlate with sentiment
indicators. Possible outcomes include: - Identifying sentiment-driven trading behavior - Quantifying
how trader activity aligns with Bitcoin market optimism/pessimism - Providing data-backed insights
for better decision-making in algorithmic or retail trading Outputs and processed results are stored
under the `/outputs` directory created in the notebook.
